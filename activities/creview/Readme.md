# C Review Activity

You will find all the details of each problem in the corresponding C file.
Please start the activity in the order shown below.

## 1. `num_seq.c`

As it currently stands, the file does not compile. You will need to do two
things:

1. Fix any compilation errors (we turned on the option that makes all warnnings
   into errors, so you need to actually read the `gcc` output).

   To compile and build the executable, use the following command:

      ```shell
      $ make num_seq
      ```

2. Read the comments in the file `num_seq.c` and complete the exercise. Once you
   are done, compile and test your code by running `make num_seq` first, then:

     ```shell
     $ ./num_seq
     ```

## 2. `str_find_next.c`

Similar to the previous problem, this one will not compile initially as well.
In addition, for this exercise, you need to write the `main` function yourself
to run some test cases.

1. Read the comments in `str_find_next.c` and complete the implementation.

2. Write the `main` function and the required test cases.

3. Compile your code using `make str_find_next` and then run it using:

    ```shell
    $ ./str_find_next
    ```

## 3. `extract_num_str.c`

For this problem, you simply need to complete the given code. Make sure to
carefully read the comments. This exercise might be a bit trickier.

Once ready, compile using `make extract_num_str` and run your code using:

  ```shell
  $ ./extract_num_str
  ```

Make sure your output looks good and it matches the expected ones.

## 4. `get_first_byte.c`

For this problem, you simply need to complete the given code. Make sure to
carefully read the comments. This exercise might be a bit trickier.

Once ready, compile using `make extract_num_str` and run your code using:

  ```shell
  $ ./extract_num_str
  ```

Make sure your output looks good and it matches the expected ones.
